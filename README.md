# StockMarketFinancialDataETL
<p> The goal of this program is to scrape the financial data from the yahoo finance API. The program will give you three options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Run the master list of stock tickers - Pulls the master ticker list into a python list and iterates over them</li>
  <li>Run a custom set of stock tickers - Specify any number of specific tickers to iterate over. The program checks if these tickers are in the master list and adds them if they are not.</li>
  <li>Run a single stock ticker - The program checks if the ticker is in the master list and adds it if it is not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a choice is made, you are then given the option to update just the price of the ticker(s), or to update the price plus all three financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Statement of Cash Flows).</p>
<p>-------------------------</p>
<p> The final goal involves pulling in the data in order to further analyze it within Microsoft Power BI.</p>
